        description: "Hullbot is a company aiming ot build a system that is able to advance and protect marine echosystems. I joined the team initially as a summer intern, working on the software for their autonomous underwater robotic platform, and have since been invited to stay on the team moving forwards. I have developed both directly on the robotic platform and its control system as well as our internal systems that aid in advancing system performance.",

        description: "A system developed from the ground up for controlling existing technology within a home. Direct control is provided to various fixtures along with autonomous scenes for ease of control. I have developed the frontend interface, and backend integration that is able to communicate and interract with lighting and comfort systems currently with additional integrations in development.",

        description: "Within the computer science society at UNSW (CSEsoc), we worked in a team to begin the development of an online platform aimed at providing a visual representation of technical computer algorithms for aid in student education. Alongside a great group of individuals I was able to enhance my skills and contribute to beginning the devlopment of an advanced software system. During my time in the team we developed a foundation for the project that permits extension by future teams.",

        description: "Applied skills in robotics controllers, pathfinding algorithms, and computer vision to implement a controller for a mobile robot. The task required mapping a maze and find a shortest path through it. Developed extensions to the application for control over tcp/ip with live video feed, autonomous maze mapping (for micro mouse competition), obstacle avoidance, and a graphical user interface. Awarded first place as a group of three for the best implementation across the whole cohort.",

        description: "Produced a controller for an unmanned ground vehicle to integrate the complex system of input and output devices into a single unit. Communicated with commercial sensors, including GPS, Lidar, providing visual representation of their data and allowing output to a motion controller on the robot itself. Applied object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques to produce a more maintainable system. Learnt about the integration of individual software packages through inter-process communication (via shared memory) and process management modules.",
